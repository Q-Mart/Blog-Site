I am an undergraduate at the University of York studying for an MEng in Computer Science with Embedded Systems Engineering. I dabble in many languages, including (in no particular order) __python, C, Java, Go and javascript__ to name a few.


In my spare time I like to __run, rock climb, read and perform stand up comedy__.
Although, my current favourite hobby is [improv comedy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Improvisational_theatre#Improvisational_comedy) and therefore, I am a member of the University's resident improv troupe, [The Shambles](http://comedysoc.github.io/shambles-website/) (I also built their website).
