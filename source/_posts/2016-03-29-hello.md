So I decided to set up a blog for various boring reasons. Mainly to document any projects I do.

This first post is nothing more that 'having a dip' in the blogging system and seeing if everything is set up correctly.

This is a [Jekyll](jekyllrb.com) run blog based on the [simplest](https://github.com/nandomoreirame/simplest) theme. I've made some of my own alterations, e.g. colour of font, navbar links and where certain links link to.
