- I'm in my final year of the MEng Computer Science with Embedded Systems Engineering (with a year in industry) degree at the University of York.

- My final year project involves implementing a [ bias lighting system ]( https://lifehacker.com/why-bias-lighting-increases-your-tvs-contrast-and-saves-1695117890 ) on an FPGA using Vivado HLS.

- I spent a year in industry as an industrial placement Technology Analyst at Morgan Stanley in which I worked on algorithmic equities trading engines in C++ and a risk calculation engine in Scala.

- Outside of my degree, I have been Assistant Head of Computing at [University Radio York](http://ury.org.uk/) and Artistic Director at the University's improvised comedy troupe, [The Shambles](http://shamblesimprov.co.uk).
