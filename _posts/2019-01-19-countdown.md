[Countdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countdown_(game_show)) is an
undisputed classic gameshow in the UK. And its comedy counterpart, [8 Out of 10
Cats Does
Countdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8_Out_of_10_Cats_Does_Countdown) is
also very popular show, returning for its 17th season in 2019.

When the University of York's [Comedy Society](https://yorkcomedysoc.co.uk/)
decided to do its own comedy Countdown show, I saw this as the perfect moment
to try and build a solver for the rounds. This post documents how I solved each
round, as well as the general architecture of the final system.

### Solving the Letters Round
>#### The Rules of the Round (in a nutshell)
>Given a random sequence of 9 letters, find the longest word that exists in
>the sequence. When generating the sequence, you have a choice between a vowel
>and a consonant. The frequency of the letters is distributed according to
>their distribution in the English language. You must have at least 3 vowels
>and 4 consonants. Once the 9 letter sequence is generated, you have 30
>seconds to find the largest word.
