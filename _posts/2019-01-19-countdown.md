[Countdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countdown_(game_show)) is an
undisputed classic gameshow in the UK. And its comedy counterpart, [8 Out of 10
Cats Does
Countdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8_Out_of_10_Cats_Does_Countdown) is
also very popular show, returning for its 17th season in 2019.
